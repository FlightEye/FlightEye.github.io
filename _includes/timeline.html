                                        showing their position, speed, altitude, etc. Using the Raspberry Pi, we gather this data and convert it to JSON.

                                    <p class="text-hidden" style="display: none;">To do this, we attach a 1090MHz antenna and GPS receiver to our Rapsberry Pi. We run a specialized program on the Raspberry Pi called dump1090 
                                        which performs the hexidemical decoding of incoming ADS-B packets. Upon decoding, each ADS-B transmission is converted to JSON format.

                                        the Raspberry Pi is powered on and the HoloLens 2 is connected to the Pi's network, data transmission will begin.

                                        the FlightEye app has been opened, the Raspberry Pi will start sending network traffic to the HoloLens 2. On the HoloLens, this data is parsed and converted into C# objects.

                                        The algorithm is a derivation of the Kalman Filter, designed to sustain the computational intensity of real-time augmented reality systems. 
                                        When activated, the UI markers will move smoothly across the viewport, modeling the instantaneous predicted location of an aircraft until a new ADS-B frame is received.

                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-hidden" style="display: none;">The predictive algorithm calculates aircraft locations based on a time-based weighted average of past ADS-B transmissions. 
                                        Predicted changes in motion are determined from 3-axis accelerations, as well as the time since the last transmission. Upon reception of new ADS-B data, errors in 
                                        prediction will be corrected by smoothly “catching” the correct position. All predictions are performed directly on the headset; this improves the fluidity of the UI and prevents pilot distraction.

                                         which consequently makes closer aircraft appear larger perspectively. Additionally, an aircraft icon is displayed on the marker which models the exact 6DOF position of the aircraft in space, and this allows 
                                         the pilot to perform a quick evaluation of each aircraft's orientation. For those who require more precise information, the numerical data corresponding to each aircraft is displayed alongside the icon.

                                        for the markers within the viewport of the operating pilot. The position of the markers is also dependent on a self-correcting system that employs an external GPS and the HoloLens internal IMU to compute user orientation and geodesic position.
